"""Actor identity — the fleet made first-class ("a man and all his imaginary friends").

Over the shared MCP server every agent writes through one process; without a per-agent
source their writes collapse into one bucket. These tests prove identity resolution, the
Agent registration (the org-chart links), and that a mounted agent's captures are
attributed to IT — hermetic against real Postgres.
