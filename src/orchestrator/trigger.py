"""The fleet trigger-hook — the mailbox's alarm clock.

The mailbox is PULL-based (Osiris has no hands): an agent perceives mail only when it takes a
turn, so coordination waits for the operator to hand-trigger the recipient. This closes that gap
WITHOUT giving Osiris hands: the WORKER (the sanctioned alarm clock / tripwire, rule #2) spawns
`claude -p` in a recipient project's repo when it has unread mail; Claude — the intelligence —
then mounts, reads its inbox, and decides. The membrane (rule #6): the loop may close, but never
silently and never irreversibly.

The named danger is the A↔B ping-pong (recursion). It is bounded by a per-project RATE CAP: at
most `rate_cap` wakes per project per `window` — each side of a loop hits its own cap and halts,
no cross-process depth-propagation needed. Every wake is recorded in agent_wakes (the visible
chain), and the whole thing is OFF unless osiris_trigger_enabled (the kill switch). Conservative
by construction: bounded, visible, killable.
