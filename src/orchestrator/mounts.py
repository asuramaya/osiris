"""The durable half of the mount registry — identity that survives a server bounce.

The MCP server's in-memory registry dies with the process, and the process dies routinely
(deploy restarts, an OOM-kill — diagnosed 56f6a0d6): every bounce wiped the WHOLE fleet's
mounts at once, and each agent rediscovered it by a hard "mount(cwd) first" failure mid-work.
This table is the memory the dict doesn't have: mount() upserts here, and any later call that
misses the dict can RE-ATTACH by the client's job_dir (presented per-request via the
X-Osiris-Job header) instead of failing until the agent notices.

Keyed by job_dir — the one durable handle the client re-presents. A mount without a job_dir
has nothing to re-attach by, so it stays memory-only (exactly the old behavior, degraded
gracefully). session_key is informational (which MCP session last touched the mount), never a
lookup key: a reconnecting client gets a fresh session id, so it can't be one.
