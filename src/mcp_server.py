"""Osiris MCP server — the AI-facing surface over the engine.

Exposes Osiris's capabilities as typed MCP tools, so any MCP client (Claude Desktop /
Code, a scheduled agent, or none at all) can DRIVE an investigation through a stable
interface — the formalization of what was previously ad-hoc Python. The same engine
backs the human front-end (the FastAPI app); the AI is an external, optional, audited
client, never embedded in the kernel, and every tool still flows through the audited
Actions layer.

    uv run python -m src.mcp_server        # stdio transport
